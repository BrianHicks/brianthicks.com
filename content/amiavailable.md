[Deep Work by Cal Newport](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted-ebook/dp/B00X47ZVXM/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1447687799&sr=8-1#nav-subnav)
is a pretty excellent book. I find myself distracted quite a lot of the time, so
I'm going to try an experiment using the rules in the book.

- **Hypothesis:** my work will be better if I schedule specific time to focus on
  it.
- **Secondary hypothesis:** people don't need an instant response from me *all
  the time*, and my professional communication will not suffer much by "going
  dark" for several hours daily.

During these periods listed below you can reach me by phone if something is
*really* urgent, but please try not to. I will respond to messages promptly when
I resurface.
