The State of Elm 2018 is on!
We put on this survey every year to take the pulse of the Elm community.
Where have we been, and where are we going?

The survey is open now and will close on March 1.
You can take it below or [in full screen mode](/state-of-elm/2018) (better for mobile users.)

Update, February 8: some browser extensions (Privacy Badger) appear to be blocking some crucial components for the survey form to work.
If the below frame appears empty or glitchy, you may need to disable blocking for now.
(If you don't want to whitelist this site permanently, an incognito/private window may do the trick.)

<div class="typeform-widget" data-url="https://brian163.typeform.com/to/n6xv4E" data-transparency="100" style="height: 700px;"></div> <script> (function() { var qs,js,q,s,d=document, gi=d.getElementById, ce=d.createElement, gt=d.getElementsByTagName, id="typef_orm", b="https://embed.typeform.com/"; if(!gi.call(d,id)) { js=ce.call(d,"script"); js.id=id; js.src=b+"embed.js"; q=gt.call(d,"script")[0]; q.parentNode.insertBefore(js,q) } })() </script> <div></div>

You can also get the [results from last year]({{< ref "post/state-of-elm-2017-results.md" >}}) and [2016]({{< ref "post/state-of-elm-2016-results.md" >}}).
