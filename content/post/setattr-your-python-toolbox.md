Today, I'm announcing the launch of [setattr]: video training and group lessons
for Python programming. Right now it's just a launch page, but I'm working hard
on creating videos and planning courses for the opening.

Long story short, the members of [STL Python][stl-python] have spoken: we need
to have more great Python training in the world, that they can get to. There are
plenty of resources to get from zero to one using Python, but a lot less to get
people to the next step, and the one after that. And so that is what we will do!

So go check it out: [www.setattr.com][setattr]
