(context: [setattr](https://www.setattr.com/) is Python training to keep your
skills sharp and your toolbox full. Here's
[why I'm building it](https://www.brianthicks.com/2014/10/29/setattr-your-python-toolbox/)
and
[the Season 1 announcement](https://www.brianthicks.com/2014/12/08/setattr-season-1/))

So... it's going great, thanks for asking! Just some bullet points:

<!--more-->

 - I've completely finished a single video. My pace is a little behind where I'd
   like it to be, but on the other hand I've learned some things about my
   recording process that will be super helpful in making the rest.
 - There are three more scripts practically done, just waiting for edits. Plus,
   I'm in the beginning stages of writing a couple of educational blog posts to
   go out in the next week to subscribers.
 - While I couldn't describe preorder sales as "brisk", I've sold more than I
   thought I could. At very least, this launch has already funded one month of
   STL Python meetings (one of the goals of launching it as a paid product.)
 
And last, just because I like sharing nice charts and stuff, here's my current
progress:

Season 1 is available (and get a free lesson, to boot!)
