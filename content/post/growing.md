A year ago yesterday I tweeted about how STL Python was at 94 members, *so
close* to 100. Those hundred members represented a big milestone for me: they
meant that STL Python was doing something that mattered. I was so excited that I
even offered a cookie to the 100th person who signed up and came to a meetup
(unfortunately nobody took me up on it!)

Fast forward a year, to 250 members this week. And that's after
[a great class][class], [9 monthly meetups][past] (we missed 3 because I
couldn't find speakers), and tons of great discussion among members. That's a
huge amount of growth for just a year, a bit over 150 new members!

I'm so grateful for all the people who have volunteered to speak, [T-REX][trex]
(our space sponsor), and of course all the wonderful people who keep showing up
to meetups. You're what keeps the community strong, so keep it going,
Pythonistas! And of course, I'd love to see you at
[our next meetup][flask-event].
