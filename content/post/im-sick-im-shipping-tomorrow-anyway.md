One of the big things I took away from [Just Fucking Ship][jfs] (which yes, you
should buy and read immediately thanks for asking) was that I should plan for
the "worst case" scenario. I put that in quotes here because I'm not talking
nuclear war here; the worst case is closer to "the dinner is inedible ok fine
buy a pizza." So when I was planning out the launch schedule for
[setattr](https://www.setattr.com/) I thought of some worst case scenarios:

 - dissatisfied customer? Keep cash on hand for refunds.
 - product sucks? Keep improving it and release free updates.
 - someone gives it to a friend, who puts it on [popular filesharing service]?
   Ask they take it down, but avoid DRM anyway 'cause it's dumb.
 
I thought I had most things planned for, but then the flu started going around
St. Louis. Oh boy. For the past couple of days I've felt "fine", but haven't had
a voice. For a product that involves screencasts, this is a no-go situation.
Fortunately, I had most of the screencasts recorded before I got taken down, but
there's one left I haven't done.

So what am I going to do? **SHIP IT ANYWAY!** Yep. You heard me. Tomorrow bright
and early the bundle will go out to everyone who's been so nice as to preorder
it, and an email will go out to everyone else a bit later. But I'm going to make
some changes: instead of shipping 4 video lessons with exercises and a
mini-lesson, I'll ship 3 video lessons with exercises, a mini-lesson, *and* a
text-only lesson with an IOU for a video component. Easy.

I'm doing it this way instead of waiting to launch because it would be silly to
sit on this just because it's "not ready" according to some arbitrary standard
of doneness. I'm even seeing now that I could have broken season 1 down into
even smaller parts and it would have been completely fine. I even sent the first
lesson out to preorder purchasers, and got some great feedback to keep going!

More later, but until tomorrow you can
[preorder setattr season 1 for $12][preorder]. Best get on that!

(p.s. pretty much all the ideas about which I've written here are sourced
directly from [JFS]. If you're interested *at all* about building something in
2015, go grab it. You won't regret it.)
