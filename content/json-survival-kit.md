You've been working on your decoder forever, and with no end in sight.
You're not sure it will ever behave.

The code compiles, and your decoder looks like it should work, but then it just… doesn't?
And worse, the normally clear compiler errors are gone.
What's going on here, anyway?

You know you're perfectly capable of decoding JSON in other languages, but you're completely flummoxed on how to do it with Elm.

## How can something that looks so easy be so hard?

Wouldn't it be wonderful if you could get what you wanted from your decoders?
You'd take the data you're given and transform it into the model you need.

Even when the data changed, you'd get exactly what you wanted for your model.
Your decoders would be stable, speedy, and adaptable.

Instead of the slog and the guesswork, you'd finish your app in record time!

## A thousand tiny decoders

That guesswork, though, is driving you mad.
It seems like you have to know how to use all the decoders already in order for the docs to make any sense.

You're not even sure when you would use some of the examples; they don't seem at all relevant… but what if they are?

It'd be great to get past JSON and on to the rest of your app, but you're out of options and out of luck.

## What if it *just worked*?

Imagine: what if you could pick out exactly which decoders you wanted and stick them together in exactly the shape of your JSON?
You'd get the type safety you started using Elm for, and be able to work with any API you wanted.

Your app would compile, you'd ship on time (or early!) and best yet: you'd know exactly what was going on under the covers.

It's easy to get stuck when you're puzzling over loading and decoding JSON, but it doesn't have to be.

## The JSON Survival Kit: make JSON decoders work for you.

You can create perfect decoders with the Elm JSON Survival Kit, a short ebook containing step-by-step examples, real-life decoders, and debugging tips.
You'll learn how all the parts fit together, break down the walls between your data and model, and finally get the type system on your side.
Sidle up your API and ship in a snap.

## Debugging? Done.

You'll learn how to get yourself unstuck—and more importantly, you'll know for sure how the whole thing works.
When you need to change your data or add a new decoder, you'll get it right the first time, every time.

Load up your favorite text editor and grab the JSON Survival Kit. You'll breeze through decoding, all your types will fit together, and you'll be one step closer to shipping your app.
