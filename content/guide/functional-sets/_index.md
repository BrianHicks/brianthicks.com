In this series, we're going to learn how to build a functional data structure using Elm.
Our goal: build a set implementation from first principles, reimplementing the [standard library's Set API](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Set).
This is going to be a toy implementation, so we won't optimize as much as we could, but we'll learn some things by doing this!
