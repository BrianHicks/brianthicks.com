Our Set implementation is done!
We just have a few things to wrap up.

## Get All the Posts

This was a long series!
If you'd like to go through it again, or didn't see all of the posts the first time, I've set up a way to get them by email.
You'll get them once per week without any interruption.

(this is temporarily turned off while I switch email providers.
Be back soon!)

## Write Your Own `Dict`

There's another fun experiment you can do now: build `Dict` on top of what we've already got!

`Dict`s are sets of keys associated with values.
In fact, core's `Set` is actually `Dict comparable ()`.
All the Set functions there are wrappers over the `Dict` functions.

Since we've already got key management, you'll just need to write some code to retrieve values.
[Core's `Dict` implementation](https://github.com/elm-lang/core/blob/master/src/Dict.elm) will be a great reference (although it uses red/black trees instead of AVL trees.)
Here's how you can change the `Set` constructors to get started:

```elm
type Dict comparable a
    = Tree Int comparable a (Dict comparable a) (Dict comparable a)
    | Empty
```

## Thanks!

Finally, thanks so much for sticking with the series as we worked through how to build a set!
Drop me a line at [brian@brianthicks.com](mailto:brian@brianthicks.com) with any feedback, or to let me know what to build next!
