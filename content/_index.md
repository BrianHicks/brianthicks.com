I'm Brian Hicks.
I work with and write about Elm, organize [elm-conf](https://www.elm-conf.us), and run the State of Elm survey.
I wrote [The JSON Survival Kit](/json-survival-kit), and would love if you checked it out!

Here are some guides:

- [How to make a set using in a functional programming style (8 parts)](/guide/functional-sets/)
